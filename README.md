# Typed Hypixel API

A library to make requests to the Hypixel API, but with TypeScript to help you avoid mistakes. This library does not modify or process any data returned, that's up to you.

I made this primarily for [skyblock-api](https://github.com/skyblockstats/skyblock-api), so information for other games may be limited. Feel free to contribute if you want these, though!

If you find missing/incorrect typings or JSDocs, please also contribute a fix.
